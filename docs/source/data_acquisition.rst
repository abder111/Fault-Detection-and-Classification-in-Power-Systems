Data Acquisition from a MATLAB Simulink Model
==============================================

Overview
========

The success of any machine learning-based fault detection system heavily depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of the training data. For PowerAI, we utilized advanced MATLAB Simulink simulation to generate a robust dataset of three-phase power system behaviors under both normal and fault conditions. This approach allows us to create controlled, labeled datasets that would be extremely difficult and dangerous to obtain from real power systems.

Comprehensive Fault Coverage
-----------------------------

To ensure our AI model can detect and classify various types of electrical faults, we systematically simulated multiple fault scenarios that commonly occur in real power systems.

**Fault Types Simulated:**

**Single-Phase Faults:**
   * **Line-to-Ground (LG) Faults:** Phase R-Ground, Phase S-Ground, Phase T-Ground
   * **Characteristics:** Most common type of fault in power systems (~80% of all faults)
   * **Simulation Parameters:** Variable fault resistance and inception angles

**Multi-Phase Faults:**
   * **Line-to-Line (LL) Faults:** RS, ST, TR phase combinations
   * **Line-to-Line-to-Ground (LLG) Faults:** Two-phase faults with ground connection
   * **Three-Phase (LLL) Faults:** Balanced and unbalanced three-phase faults
   * **Three-Phase-to-Ground (LLLG) Faults:** Most severe fault condition

Fault Parameter Variations
---------------------------

To create a comprehensive dataset that represents real-world conditions, each fault type was simulated with various parameters:

**Fault Inception Time:**
   * **Range:** 0.1s to 0.9s within the simulation cycle
   * **Purpose:** Capture fault behavior at different points in the AC waveform
   * **Variations:** Multiple inception times for each fault type

**Fault Resistance:**
   * **Low Resistance Faults:** 0.01Ω - 1Ω (solid faults)
   * **Medium Resistance Faults:** 1Ω - 10Ω (arc faults)
   * **High Resistance Faults:** 10Ω - 100Ω (incipient faults)

**Fault Duration:**
   * **Temporary Faults:** 0.1s - 0.5s
   * **Permanent Faults:** 0.5s - 2.0s
   * **Clearing Time:** Variable based on protection system response

**Switching Time Analysis**
