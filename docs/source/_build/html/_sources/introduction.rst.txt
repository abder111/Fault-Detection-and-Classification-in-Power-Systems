Three-phase electrical systems form the backbone of modern energy distribution infrastructure. These systems consist of three phase conductors (R, S, T) offset by 120° and a neutral conductor, enabling efficient electrical energy transmission.

Key Advantages of Three-Phase Systems:
---------------------------------------

* **Constant Power Transmission:** Provides steady, continuous power delivery
* **Load Balancing:** Ensures optimal distribution of electrical loads
* **Reduced Line Losses:** Minimizes energy waste during transmission
* **Equipment Optimization:** Enables efficient operation of transformers and motors

System Input Data
-----------------

Three-phase systems generate six fundamental electrical signals that contain comprehensive information about system status:

* **3 Phase Currents:** IR, IS, IT (Amperes)
* **3 Phase Voltages:** VR, VS, VT (Volts)

**Information Richness:** These six signals contain all necessary information to precisely characterize system state and identify anomalies with high accuracy.

Common Fault Types in Power Systems:
-------------------------------------

* **Short Circuits:** Phase-to-ground, phase-to-phase, and three-phase faults
* **Insulation Failures:** Breakdown of protective insulation materials
* **Overloads and Imbalances:** Excessive current or unbalanced loading conditions
* **Electrical Arc Faults:** Dangerous arcing between conductors

Consequences of Undetected Faults:
-----------------------------------

**Safety Risks:**

* Fire hazards and potential explosions
* Electrocution dangers
* Equipment damage and failure

**Economic Impact:**

* Production shutdowns and downtime
* Costly equipment replacement
* Revenue losses due to service interruptions

**Service Quality:**

* Power supply disruptions
* Voltage fluctuations and instabilities

**Regulatory Compliance:**

* Non-compliance with safety standards and regulations
* Potential legal liabilities

Time-Critical Detection Requirements
------------------------------------

**Temporal Challenge:** Fault detection must be instantaneous (within milliseconds) to prevent fault propagation and limit damage to the electrical infrastructure.
